 After launching the program, a splash screen appears, which can be skipped by pressing any key on the keyboard. After the splash screen, the program's main menu appears, where you can choose from 4 options.

In the "Settings" section, you can select the puzzle difficulty and program language (2 languages   are available, Russian and English. Russian is the default).

In the "Information" section, you can read information about me and my product, as well as information about copyright for the program.

When selecting the "Exit" option, the program exits.

When choosing the "Start" option, a new window opens where you need to select a level. The program has a total of 10 levels, each of which differs only in the image.

When starting a level, a canvas for assembling the puzzle appears on the left side of the screen, and an example of assembly and puzzle pieces appears on the right side. The ultimate goal of the game is to assemble the puzzle. To do this, you need to move all puzzle pieces to the correct positions on the canvas. Movement occurs by holding down the LMB on the piece and then dragging it to the desired position. Where a bright square lights up on the canvas, you can release the piece and it will automatically fit into that position.

If the wrong level was selected, you can always exit the puzzle using the ESC key, in which case you will have the opportunity to select a level again.

In case of correct assembly of the puzzle, a final picture and congratulations will appear. After pressing any key on the keyboard, the main menu opens.
